# Clean architecture - samples

The goal is to show possible implementations of the different architecture styles mentioned by [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Robert-C-Martin/dp/0134494164)

# Mentioned patterns

- Package by layer
- Package by Feature
- Ports and Adapters
- Package by Component

# Languages

Ideally we can show the implementations with different languages/Frameworks.

I will start with typescript/nestjs as I am currently working with it :)

The result should be placed inside a folder within the [packages](packages/) folder, following a naming scheme something like `[lang]_[framework]_[pattern name]`.
